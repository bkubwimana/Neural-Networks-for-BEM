This folder contains the EnergyPlus model for the building modeled in this study

Download EnergyPlus from https://energyplus.net/downloads. Note that compatibility with your system is important.
You can also just use Openstudio as the front end, but you still need to download E+ so Open can call it on your system.
Use the EnergyModel IDF (input data file) in this repos to start your analysis either in OpenStudio or E+ directly.
