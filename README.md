# Neural-Networks-for-BEM
Artificial Neural Netoworks for Building Energy Modeling.
If you want to learn more about this project, please read my thesis file. Otherwise, these are the questions that this projects answers.

Is it possible to build an accurate Neural Network Based Surrogate Model from a physics-based model?

Can we use the Genetic Algorithm to optimize building energy consumption of Surrogate Models?

What are the benefits of Genetic Algorithm compared to Bayesian Algorithm when optimizing surrogate models?
