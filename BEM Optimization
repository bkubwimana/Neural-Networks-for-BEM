The optimization performed here is not the same as the optimization performed
while developing the NN prediction model. The optimization is meant to find design
variables that provide the minimum building energy consumption; this is done using a
genetic function minimization algorithm. The NN surrogate model can only predict the
energy consumption given a design variable inputs and doesn’t modify the design variable.
The surrogate model is enhanced when coupled with the GA to predict and select the best
design variables with the lowest building energy consumption. Genetic algorithms make it
possible to find a function's maximum (or a minimum), using operations analogous to those
in the DNA of living beings: selection, crossing, and mutations 

The optimization process was carried out in 5 steps. The first step was population
initialization, which is achieved by producing 100 different outputs from the surrogate model
and saving the corresponding values for each design variable.
The second step is candidate selection. The selection process involves taking candidates
from the population in the mating pool. Based on the previously calculated energy
consumption value, a threshold (lower energy consumption than previously calculated) is
used to select the best individuals. From the selected subset, parents are prepared for the
mating. Selecting the parents to be used in mating is done using the Roulette wheel selection,
which is an efficient way of selecting candidates by giving a higher probability of selection
to the parents that have a lower energy consumption design model. The third step involves
doing a crossover, where offspring are generated from two candidate parents. These
offsprings have similar genetic properties as their parents, mathematically represented as
decimal values in this study. Offsprings are then mutated to provide a different version with
different genetic properties from its parent. New offspring are merged with the population,
and the pool is sorted. Poor candidates are eliminated from the population. The remaining
population is part of a new generation that undergoes a similar process starting from step 1
until a solution with the lowest energy consumption can not be overtaken. The process should
51
be done in only 100 iterations; thus, either the minimum or energy consumption is reached,
or the iterations are reached. The last step is terminating the process when the best solution
is reached, and this can be compared as reaching the global minimum. 


The minimization function approach is summarised with the equation below

The GA optimization approach minimizes the energy consumption of the pandemic
surrogate model. In other words, GA determines design variables that produce a building
model with minimized energy use. The surrogate model is used as a fitness function to find
a building design that may provide a lower energy consumption. These results can be
compared to the results and design obtained when the minimization is done using the
Bayesian Algorithm. 

Comparatively, the Bayesian optimization uses a surrogate model as a black-box function to
be minimized. An available package within python called Scikit Optimizer allows
implementing the Bayesian optimization on the surrogate model. Thus this was worth
implementing on the already developed surrogate model to compare the performance with
the self-developed genetic algorithm; most of the inputs to this Bayesian algorithm are
similar to those used in the genetic algorithm. Since the optimization variables considered in
this study do not change for both the pandemic and regular operation models, the
optimization illustration is only performed on the regular operation surrogate model.
