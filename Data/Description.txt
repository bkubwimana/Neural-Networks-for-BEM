Performing multiple simulations can be made easier by automating the process. In this study,
Python is being used to perform simulations on a locally installed EnergyPlus software
iteratively. Thus, running multiple simulations is automated to reduce the time that would
otherwise be taken to manually run individual simulations and later gather all data needed to
develop the NN surrogate model. A Python package, Eppy, was used to work with
EnergyPlus using Python.
